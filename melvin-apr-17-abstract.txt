Functional Programming from First Principles

We've heard a number of talks this semester on functional programming
languages such as Elixir and Scala. These languages are large and complicated,
which makes it difficult to understand the essence of functional programming.

Church's Lambda Calculus is the oldest and simplest possible functional
programming language. It has the following syntax:
<var> ::= a | b | ... | z
<exp> ::= <var> | (\<var> <exp>) | (<exp> <exp>)

In this talk, we will explore Church's Lambda Calculus via a series of demos
based on Tromp's 2012 IOCCC winning entry,
http://www.ioccc.org/2012/tromp/hint.html An unobfuscated version of the above
is available at https://github.com/melvinzhang/binary-lambda-calculus and will
be used for the demos in this talk.
